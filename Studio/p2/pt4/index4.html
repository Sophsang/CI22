    <h2>
        One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and <br>
        that is the apostrophe for possession. Well feel as you like about <br>
        that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive <br>
         case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very <br>
         difficult to definitely decide to do without it. One does do without it, <br>
          I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I  <br>
          feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make <br>
           the possessive case. I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out <br>
           I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside <br>
           a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness <br>
           to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to time I do find <br>
           myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. <br>
           I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in. <br>
