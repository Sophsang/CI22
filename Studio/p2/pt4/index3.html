    <h2>	Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, they are unnecessary, <br>
         they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use, <br>
          if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question. <br>
           The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply <br>
           impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and now <br>
           anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at <br>
           any rate anybody can and does see it that way.</h2>
