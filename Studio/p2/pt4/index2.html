    <h2>	Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is <br>
         the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used <br> 
         as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing <br> 
        it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. It is evident that is you ask a <br>
         question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is <br>
          a question as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore <br>
           should one use the question mark. Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing
           <br> and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an 
           <br> unnecessary name of something. A question is a question, anybody can know that a question
           <br> is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the 
           <br> question is already there in the writing. Therefore I never could bring myself to use a 
           <br> question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it. </h2>
