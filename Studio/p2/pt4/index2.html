    <h2>Of these the one but the first and the most the <br>
        completely most uninteresting is the question mark. <br>
        The question mark is alright when it is all alone <br>
        when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it <br>
        could be used in decoration but connected with <br>
        writing it is completely entirely completely <br> 
        uninteresting. It is evident that is you ask a <br>
        question you ask a question but anybody who can <br>
        read at all knows when a question is a question <br>
        as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you <br>
        therefore wherefore should one use the question mark. <br>
        Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary <br>
        printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the <br>
        ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary <br>
        name of something. A question is a question, <br>
        anybody can know that a questionis a question and <br>
        so why add to it the question mark when it is <br>
        already there when the question is already there <br>
        in the writing. Therefore I never could bring myself <br>
        to use a question mark, I always found it positively <br>
        revolting, and now very few do use it.
