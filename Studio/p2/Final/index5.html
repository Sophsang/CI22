    <h2>	
            When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, 
        I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began 
        writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing
         should go on and on and if writing should go on what had colons 
         and commas to do with it, what had periods to do with it what 
         had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing
          going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in 
          connection with writing. What had colons and semi-colons to do 
          with it what had commas to do with it what had periods to do with
           it.</h2> 
          <h2> What had periods to do with it. Inevitably no matter how completely
        I had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again
        stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop sometime and
        if one had to again and again stop some time then periods had to
        exist. Beside I had always like the look of periods and I liked
        what they did. Stopping sometime did not really keep one from 
        going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that 
        happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I 
        did not believe in periods and I used them. I really never stopped 
        using them.</h2>
    
           <h2> Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to 
        commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, that has happened 
        lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later
         I will read you a little of it. By the time I had written this poem 
         about three years ago periods had come to have for me completely a 
         life of their own. They could begin to act as they thought best and 
         one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not really 
         interrupt one’s writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily
          stop at times in one’s writing and so they could be used and you 
          could use them Periods could come to exist in this way and they could
        come in this way to have a life of their own. They did not serve you in 
        any servile way as commas and colons and semi-colons do. Yes you do 
        feel what I mean. </h2>
    
         <h2>   Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling 
        of their own a time of their own. And that feeling that life that 
        necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety that 
        is the reason that I have always remained true to periods so much 
        so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them more 
        than one had ever needed them.
