        <h2>Conclusion
            When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, 
            verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became 
            a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs 
            aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the 
            whole of the active life of writing.Â </h2>
            
            <h2> make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always
             liked dependent adverbial clauses. I have like dependent adverbial clauses
              because of their variety of dependence and independence. You can see how
               loving the intensity of complication of these things that commas would 
            be degrading. Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final 
            simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to 
            bring about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. 
            Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I do. </h2>
            
            <h2>Think about anything you really like to do and you will see what I mean.</h2>
            
            <h2> When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to 
                cut the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, 
                so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is 
                writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written. And what 
                does a comma do, a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you 
                like it enough is easy enough without the comma. A long complicated sentence 
                should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the comma, 
                well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a 
                breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that 
                you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has something 
                to do with going on, but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath 
                and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath. Anyway that is the 
                way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so I 
                almost never used a comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence 
                the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after 
                another, the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate 
                need of their taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them, 
                and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.</h2>
            
             <h2>So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little
             different but more so and later I will go into that. But that is the way I 
             felt about punctuation in prose.</h2>
